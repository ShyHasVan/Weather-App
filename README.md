# Weather-App

This repository hosts the code for a weather application developed using Django that provides real-time weather information and forecasts for various cities. The app leverages the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve weather data and display it in a user-friendly manner. Users can input a city's name and receive current weather conditions and a 5-day forecast.

The main features of this weather app include:

Real-Time Weather Data: The app fetches up-to-date weather information from the OpenWeatherMap API, including temperature, description, sunrise and sunset times, wind speed, cloudiness, rain, pressure, and humidity.

Forecast Display: Beyond current conditions, the app also offers a 5-day forecast with temperature and weather descriptions for each day. The daily forecast helps users plan ahead based on anticipated weather changes.

User-Friendly Interface: The app is designed with a user-friendly interface that allows users to input a city name and quickly retrieve weather data. If the provided city is not found or weather data is unavailable, appropriate error messages are displayed.

Icon Representation: To enhance the visual experience, the app employs weather icons corresponding to the current conditions and forecasts. These icons provide users with a quick visual summary of weather conditions.

Modular Design: The code follows a modular design pattern, separating the logic for fetching weather data and forecasts into distinct functions. This approach promotes code readability, maintainability, and future expansion.
